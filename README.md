# Car Object Detection Project

## Overview

This project implements a **Car Object Detection** system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model detects cars in images and draws bounding boxes around them. The project uses the **Kaggle Car Object Detection Dataset** for training and testing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ObjectDetection-Project
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-object-detection) and place the training images, testing images, and annotation files in the `data/` folder.

## Usage

### 1. **Train the Model**:
Run the following command to train the object detection model:

```bash
python src/model.py
```

The model will be trained and saved to the `models/` directory as `object_detection_model.h5`.

### 2. **Evaluate the Model**:
After training, evaluate the model on the test images:

```bash
python src/evaluate_model.py
```

This script will load the trained model and generate bounding box predictions on the test images.

## Model Architecture

The object detection model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predicts bounding box coordinates for the detected cars in the images. It uses several layers:

- Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction.
- Fully connected layers for bounding box regression.

The output layer predicts 4 values: `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)` for bounding boxes.

## Results

After training for 10 epochs, the model achieves **mean squared error (MSE)** as the loss function for bounding box prediction. Example predictions on test images are provided below:

![Sample Prediction 1](path_to_image_1)  
![Sample Prediction 2](path_to_image_2)

## Future Improvements

- **Data Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Experiment with pre-trained models like ResNet or MobileNet for better accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for better performance.

### What to do next:
- **Add sample images** to the `README.md` to showcase your model's predictions.
- **Push your README** to GitHub once complete:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added project README"
git push
```
